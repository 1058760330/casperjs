<h2 id="faq-help">I'm stuck! I think there's a bug! What can I do?</h2>

Before rage-tweeting:

1. Read the [docs](http://casperjs.org/)
2. Check if an [issue](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues) has been open about your problem already
3. Check you're running the [latest stable tag](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/tags)
4. Check you're running the [latest version](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/downloads/list) of PhantomJS
5. Ask on the [project mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/casperjs):
   - try to post a reproducible, minimal test case
   - compare casperjs results with native phantomjs ones
   - if the problem also occurs with native phantomjs, ask on [phantomjs mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/phantomjs)
6. Eventually, [file an issue](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/new).

<h2 id="faq-modularization">I keep copy and pasting stuff in my test scripts, that's boring</h2>

Have a look at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/3813361), it might help.

Also, don't forget that CasperJS supports a [CommonJS-compliant module pattern](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1)
implementation. Note that CasperJS' implementation differs a bit from the one provided by PhantomJS, but
I personnaly never really encountered any functional difference.

* * * * *

<h2 id="faq-versioning">What is the versioning policy of CasperJS?</h2>

Releases will follow the [SemVer standard](http://semver.org/); they
will be numbered with the follow format:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>[-<identifier>]
```

And constructed with the following guidelines:

- Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
- New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
- Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
- Unstable, special and trunk versions will have a proper identifier

<h2 id="#faq-steps">What does then() really mean in CasperJS?</h2>

I took the time to properly answer [this question on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11957919/330911).

<h2 id="faq-jquery">Can I use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) with CasperJS?</h2>

Sure, as every single other javascript library on Earth.

A first solution is to inject it into the remote DOM environment by
hand using the standard `WebPage.injectJs()` method:

```javascript
casper.page.injectJs('/path/to/jquery.js');
```

If you need jQuery being available everytime, you can also make it being
injected in every received response by setting the `clientScripts`
option of CasperJS:

```javascript
var casper = require('casper').create({
    clientScripts: ["includes/jquery.min.js"]
});
```

<span class="label label-info">Note</span>
You can't *inject* scripts using the HTTP protocol, you actually have to use
a relative/absolute filesystem path to the script resource.

* * * * *

<h2 id="faq-executable">Can I use CasperJS without using the `casperjs` executable?</h2>

Yes, you can call a CasperJS script directly with the `phantomjs`
executable, but if you do so, you must set the `phantom.casperPath`
property to the path where the library root is located on your system:

```javascript
// casperscript.js
phantom.casperPath = '/path/to/casperjs';
phantom.injectJs(phantom.casperPath + '/bin/bootstrap.js');

var casper = require('casper').create();
// ...
```

You can run such a script like any other standard PhantomJS script:

```
$ phantomjs casperscript.js
```

**If you're on Windows**, this is the way you may manage to get casper working
the most easily:

```javascript
phantom.casperPath = 'C:\\path\\to\\your\\repo\\lib\\casperjs-0.6.X';
phantom.injectJs(phantom.casperPath + '\\bin\\bootstrap.js');

var casper = require('casper').create();

// do stuff
```

<h2 id="faq-httpstatuses">How can I catch HTTP 404 and other status codes?</h2>

You can define your own
[HTTP status code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
handlers by using the `httpStatusHandlers` option of the Casper object. You can
also catch other HTTP status codes as well, as demoed below:

```javascript
var casper = require('casper').create();

casper.on('http.status.404', function(resource) {
    this.echo('wait, this url is 404: ' + resource.url);
});

casper.on('http.status.500', function(resource) {
    this.echo('woops, 500 error: ' + resource.url);
});

casper.start('http://mywebsite/404', function() {
    this.echo('We suppose this url return an HTTP 404');
});

casper.thenOpen('http://mywebsite/500', function() {
    this.echo('We suppose this url return an HTTP 500');
});

casper.run(function() {
    this.echo('Done.').exit();
});
```

<h2 id="faq-utils">What's this mysterious `__utils__` object?</h2>

The `__utils__` object is actually an instance of the [`ClientUtils`](api.html#client-utils) class which
have been automatically injected into the page DOM and is therefore always available.

So everytime to perform an [`evaluate()`](api.html#casper.evaluate) call, you have this instance available
to perform common operations like:

- fetching nodes using CSS3 or XPath selectors,
- retrieving information about element properties (attributes, size, bounds, etc.),
- sending AJAX requests,
- triggering DOM events

Check out the [whole API](api.html#client-utils). You even have
[a bookmarklet](api.html#bookmarklet) to play around with this `__utils__` instance
right within your browser console!

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> You're not obliged at all to use the `__utils__`
instance in your scripts. It's just there because it's used by CasperJS internals.

<h2 id="faq-step-stack">How does `then()` and the step stack work?</h2>

<span class="label label-info">Disclaimer</span> This entry is based on an
[answer I made on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11957919/330911).

The `then()` method basically adds a new navigation step in a stack. A step is a
javascript function which can do two different things:

1. waiting for the previous step - if any - being executed
2. waiting for a requested url and related page to load

Let's take a simple navigation scenario:

```js
var casper = require('casper').create();

casper.start();

casper.then(function step1() {
    this.echo('this is step one');
});

casper.then(function step2() {
    this.echo('this is step two');
});

casper.thenOpen('http://google.com/', function step3() {
    this.echo('this is step 3 (google.com is loaded)');
});
```

You can print out all the created steps within the stack like this:

```js
require('utils').dump(casper.steps.map(function(step) {
    return step.toString();
}));
```

That gives:

```js
$ casperjs test-steps.js
[
    "function step1() { this.echo('this is step one'); }",
    "function step2() { this.echo('this is step two'); }",
    "function _step() { this.open(location, settings); }",
    "function step3() { this.echo('this is step 3 (google.com is loaded)'); }"
]
```

Notice the `_step()` function which has been added automatically by CasperJS to
load the url for us; when the url is loaded, the next step available in the
stack — which is `step3()` — is *then* called.

When you have defined your navigation steps, `run()` executes them one by one
sequentially:

```js
casper.run();
```

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> The callback/listener stuff is an
implementation of the [Promise pattern](http://blog.thepete.net/blog/2011/07/02/javascript-promises/).

<h2 id="faq-parallel">Is it possible to achieve parallel browsing using CasperJS?</h2>

[Officially no](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/casperjs/Scx4Cjqp7hE/discussion),
but you may want to try.

<h2 id="faq-javascript">Okay, honestly, I'm stuck with Javascript.</h2>

Don't worry, you're not alone. Javascript is a great language, but it's far more
difficult to master than one might expect at first look.

Here are some great resources to get started efficiently with the language:

- Learn and practice Javascript online at [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
- [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html)
- [JavaScript Enlightenment](http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/JavaScript_Enlightenment.pdf) (PDF)
- last, a [great tutorial on Advanced Javascript Techniques](http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/)
  by John Resig, the author of jQuery. If you master this one, you're almost done with
  the language.
