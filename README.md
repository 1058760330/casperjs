CasperJS Documentation
======================

This branch contains the source for the public [CasperJS.org](http://casperjs.org/)
website. Previously it hosted the docs for the 1.0.x branch, which have been
migrated to readthedocs.org and are now managed using Sphinx and browseable at
[docs.casperjs.org](http://docs.casperjs.org).

To contribute to the casperjs documentation, switch to `master` and update the
files within the `docs` directory (hint: you can even edit them right from the
github Web UI and send a PR right from there).
