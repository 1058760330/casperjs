CasperJS Changelog
==================

2012-01-12, v0.6.0
------------------

- **BC BREAK:** `Casper.click()` now uses native Webkit mouse events instead of previous crazy utopic javascript emulation
- **BC BREAK:** All errors thrown by CasperJS core are of the new `CasperError` type
- **BC BREAK:** removed obsolete `replaceFunctionPlaceholders()`
- *Deprecated*: `Casper.extend()` method has been deprecated; use natural javascript extension mechanisms instead (see samples)
- added `$ casperjs test` command for running split test suites
- `Casper.open()` can now perform HTTP `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and `HEAD` operations
- commonjs/nodejs-like module exports implementation
- ported nodejs' `events` module to casperjs; lots of events added, plus some value filtering capabilities
- introduced the `mouse` module to handle native Webkit mouse events
- added support for `RegExp` input in `Casper.resourceExists()`
- added printing of source file path for any uncaught exception printed onto the console
- added an emulation of stack trace printing (but PhantomJS will have to upgrade its javascript engine for it to be fully working though)
